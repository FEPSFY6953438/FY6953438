  How an American football travels through the air depends heavily on how the ball spins, including the direction and speed of how the ball is spinning. 
  The shape of an American football is a prolate spheroid: a sphere that has been stretched and has pointed ends. When an American football rotates around
  its long axis, it experiences gyroscopic effects. This can greatly change how the ball travels through the air and provide a benefit, or disadvantage, 
  during the game…

  In American football, the ball is a prolate spheroid instead of a perfect sphere, as a ball usually is in most sports. A perfect sphere is symmetrical in 
  every way whereas an American football is not, this means air resistance has a much more drastic effect on an American football, and the ball can tumble 
  through the air unpredictably. It is often desired to throw the ball with a perfect spiral, spinning perfectly around the axis and cutting through the air. 
  At first thought, if the ball were to wobble and tumble through the air, its movements would be unpredictable, the ball would never go where it is intended. 
  Whilst this is mostly true, the perfect throw of an American football has the perfect amount of wobble, which helps it to maintain its approximate parabolic 
  trajectory, as it keeps the pointed end of the ball facing approximately in the direction the ball is moving at all times. However, when investigating this, 
  a question arises; the aerodynamic torque that keeps the long axis of the ball following its trajectory, would actually, at first glance, have the opposite 
  effect on the ball (Ref: Paradox…). Due to the immense popularity of American football, and the incredible amount of money involved with the sport, a large 
  amount of studies have been conducted to investigate the aerodynamics of the peculiarly shaped ball, all with one question in mind: how can we reach 
  perfection? (Ref: Wind-tunnel…)

  In more complicated modelling of the aerodynamics of the ball many forces and effects are considered, including: the drag force, the lift force, the overturning 
  moment, the Magnus effect, and the force due to gravity (Ref: Modelling…). However, to gain a simple understanding, gravity can be neglected and it can be assumed 
  that the ball is moving in a straight line. The ball can be placed in a wind tunnel, with the pointed end facing into the wind. If the ball were to be tilted up 
  slightly, the surface area of the ball coming into contact with the oncoming wind would be far greater on the underside of the ball, and due to the shape of the 
  ball, this air would also be deflected downwards (Ref: Aerodynamics…). This would create a significant force that would lift the underside of the ball up, until 
  the pointed tip of the ball is facing vertically. The centre of mass of an object when thrown will in theory always follow a parabolic trajectory if no external 
  forces other than gravity are acting on it. Putting this into a real world situation, it would be naturally expected that when the ball is thrown at an upwards 
  angle (for example 45 degrees), the centre of mass of the ball would follow a parabola, but the tip of the ball would not, causing the underside to be exposed 
  to more air resistance, eventually causing it to turn upwards. Then as the ball falls again it would turn back around following the same principle, tumbling end 
  over end. This does not happen, however, when the ball is spinning along its long axis - usually known as the ball being thrown with a “spiral” within the sport. 

  The ball will only follow its parabolic trajectory if the pointed tip of the ball moves in a small circular path instead of staying head on. As was discovered 
  with a non-spinning ball, when the ball tilts slightly, it causes it to tilt even more in that direction due to air resistance. This changes when the ball is 
  spinning because of angular momentum. The ball would still experience a greater initial force from air resistance on its underside, but because the ball is 
  spinning, the momentum of this force is carried around the rotation, and the ball would actually tilt 90 degrees to the right (if thrown clockwise, which would 
  happen by throwing the ball right-handed). Now there is more air resistance on the right side of the ball, this force is carried around the rotation, causing the 
  ball to point downwards. The process continues over and over again in what is called gyroscopic procession. That process is how the long axis of the ball 
  (and its point) follows the parabolic trajectory of the ball and constantly faces in the approximate direction that the ball is travelling. The process of the tip
  of the ball moving in a circular path can be described as an oscillation. The perfect angle that the ball’s long axis deviates away from the trajectory is found 
  by one study to be 9 degrees (Ref: Paradox…)

  From this research, it can clearly be seen that the spin of the ball drastically changes how it travels through the air. It also disproves the common misconception 
  that throwing the ball with a perfect tight spiral, where it doesn’t wobble at all, is the best way to throw a ball, because it is actually impossible to. The ball 
  wants to naturally wobble to follow its gyroscopic procession and helps it to stay stable during flight. This makes the throws of the players much more accurate and 
  helps the players trying to catch the ball track the ball much better. Therefore the perfect pass does not actually have the tightest possible spiral, the perfect 
  pass wobbles the perfect amount.
